                    <h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2>
                    <p>Bitcoin at its core is simply a global ledger that records new blocks of transactions to a chain, each new block of transactions is added every ten minutes.
                        This is where the term 'blockchain' originated from.<br><br>
                        Bitcoin is a new form of money, one more suitable for the incresingly digital world in which we find 
                        ourselves in. Bitcoin is not to be confused with buzzwords such as 'Crypto'. This term was highjacked by bad actors to sell unlicenced securities 
                        to vunerable retail investors. There are countless thousands of 'cryptocurrencies' on the market today, very few if any have any real, tangible value 
                        associated with them, almost all will fail in the long run. This site will help you to understand why this is so.<br><br>
                        Bitcoin does not have a CEO, a board of directors, a team of marketers or any influence from venture capitalists. It is simply a piece of open source software.
                        <br><br>
                        So what is it that makes Bitcoin unique? Couldn't it just be replicated? Why would governments allow it? What's the issue with fiat currencies?
