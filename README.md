## The Intended Purpose of This Website:

This website was designed and built with the intention of rapidly grabbing the attention of a complete novice who has heard of Bitcoin but know nothing of what it is, why it exists or what to compare it to. The user of this site instantly gets a brief overview of what Bitcoin is and why they should steer clear of other 'cryptocurrencies'. A list of Bitcoin's most redeeming features is then provided. There are some external links provided on each point to allow the user understand better what each piece of terminology actually means. It is beleief of the author of this site that new terminology relating to a field is one of the first items a new learner has to come to terms with so the purpose of this list was to give an understanding of some of the core concepts involved when trying to assess this technology. An option to sign up to a newsletter is provided for those who would like to learn more than is provided on the website. A list of some more advanced reading is provided for those who are interested, and for those who prefer not to read, some videos from experts in the field who deal with the topics of Fiat Currency and Bitcoin from first principles are provided so the user can try to compare the properties of each against each other.

# Live Features:
- Header
    - Navigation Links
    - Main Website Logo

The header for the website contains both the main website logo which contains two Bitcoin icons from font-awesome. 
The header also contains the main site navigation links for the page. I decided to have the links fixed to the top of the page as the page is designed to be scrollable.
The navigation links have contrasting hover styles to give an improved user experience. This header is appled to the 'submitted form' page and will be applied to any added pages in the future.
