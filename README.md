## The Intended Purpose of This Website:

This website was designed and built with the intention of rapidly grabbing the attention of a complete novice who has heard of Bitcoin but knows nothing of what it is, why it exists or what to compare it to. The user of this site instantly gets a brief overview of what Bitcoin is and why they should steer clear of other 'cryptocurrencies'. A list of Bitcoin's most redeeming features is then provided. There are some external links provided with each point made to allow the user understand better what each piece of terminology actually means.
It is beleief of the author of this site that terminology relating to an unknown field of interest is one of the first items a new learner has to come to terms with so the purpose of this list was to give an understanding of some of the core concepts involved when trying to assess this technology.
An option to sign up to a newsletter is provided for those who would like to learn more than is provided on the website.
A list of some more advanced reading is provided for those who are interested, and for those who prefer not to read, some videos from experts in the field who deal with the topics of Fiat Currency and Bitcoin from first principles are provided so the user can try to compare the properties of each against each other.

![Header for the website containing navigation elements](https://github.com/gfpkelly1986/beginners-bitcoin/blob/main/assets/css/images/Bitcoin-Images/Features%20screenshots/header_feature.PNG)

The header for the website contains both the main website logo which contains two Bitcoin icons from font-awesome. 
The header also contains the main site navigation links for the page. I decided to have the links fixed to the top of the page as the page is designed to be scrollable.
The navigation links have contrasting hover styles to give an improved user experience. This header is appled to the 'submitted form' page and will be applied to any added pages in the future.

This section breifly describes Bitcoin, explains to the user that it is a global ledger of account that records transactions every ten minutes and adds them to a chain. It gives a brief warning not to consider other cryptocurrencies to be the same as Bitcoin. One is property, the other a security.

![A list of 10 items each one a quality of bitcoin](https://github.com/gfpkelly1986/beginners-bitcoin/blob/main/assets/css/images/Bitcoin-Images/Features%20screenshots/unique_btc_feature.PNG)

This section introduces the user to some terminology used in the space and attempts to hightlight quickly to the user the 10 main properties that make Bitcoin a unique and valuable invention. All of the obscure terminology links out to external sources to allow the user gain a better understanding of what these 10 points actually mean.

This section gives the user a reason as to why they might like to subscribe to the sites mailing list. It provides the user with some testimonials from previous subscribers and 2 form fields for their details, one input for email and another for their name. The form when submitted takes the user to a 'submitted form page' to provide the user with feedback.

![Footer containing social linksvand copyright](https://github.com/gfpkelly1986/beginners-bitcoin/blob/main/assets/css/images/Bitcoin-Images/Features%20screenshots/footer_feature.PNG)

# Desired Features
- Hamburger menu for mobile users
    -This feature will need to be added for mobile users to eliminate the need for the fixed navigation that takes up too much screen real estate particularly for the landscape orientation mobile user.
- Update the social links to share the current page.
    - Social links need to be updated to allow the users land directly on the message board of the social media websites.
- Tech Talk section
    - This section would be where the user can learn how to  purchase and store/secure their Bitcoin. There would be a comparison of 'hot' and 'cold' wallet options, there would also be an easy to understand explanation of how the public and private keys create transactions and how wallets essentially show these transactions and don't actually store anything in them. (as opposed to current centralized applications.)

- A history of money section and modern money mechanics.
    - This section would provide users with an education in how and when Fiat currencies were created. It would also explain why they were created and what problem they solved at the time. A comparison of the fundamental properties of fiat currency and Bitcoin would be provided.
    
- The Lightning Network section
    - This section would explain to users what the Ligtning Network is, how it provided the Bitcoin network with the ability to route micro payments over 2nd layer channels and what it means for the world that there is now a global, open source monetary network available for micro payments that any developer in the world can build on top of.

# Validator Testing
![Results for Accessibility and SEO](https://github.com/gfpkelly1986/beginners-bitcoin/blob/main/assets/css/images/accessibility_score_BTC.PNG)

- Light house on Google Chrome was used to test the webpage for Accessibility and SEO. The results were 98 for accessibility and 100 for SEO.

-  The W3C Schools HTML validator was used to test the markup for the site. There were no errors in the final markup but there were errors fixed during development. Some of these errors were incorrect use of ul elements nested inside ol elements, h3 elements nested inside label elements and iframes with incorrect border attributes that were outdated and replaced with CSS.
-  The W3C Schools CSS validator was used to test the CSS during development and before final push to git hub. There were no CSS errors returned from this validator.

# Bugs (During Development)
- Duplicate CSS code
   - A major bug during development was duplicate code copied into the CSS Stylesheet. I had hit CTRL C as opossed to CTRL X on some code to move it down the page and it was not until major styles started to fail that I realised the error. To fix I had to comment out all styles to the main image section and when this was done I realised there were duplicate styles further down the stylesheet which were overwriting the styles applied further up the stylesheet. 
    
- Header Styles that were not being appied
    - A second bug during development: This bug was caused by extra html closing tags left behind from copy and pasting code that prevented the header from loading its styles correctly. This took some time to locate as it was not instantly obvious that the issue was with the markup. It was not until removing all applied CSS styles to the page by commenting them out that it became obvious the issue was in the index.html file.
    
# Bugs (Issues to be resolved)
- One bug/issue that persists is the view of the site when on landscape orientation of a mobile viewport. The fixed header is too large and needs to be replaced with a hamburger menu or a header that scrolls with the webpage.
- Slow loading of images in the email subscriber section possibly due to how the image is being served to the browser

# Deployment
- This webpage was deployed to git hub pages at the following link  [My git hub pages link of live website](https://gfpkelly1986.github.io/beginners-bitcoin/) 
- Steps taken
    1. Go to settings tab at the top banner of the repository page in question.
    2. Click on pages on the left hand menu
    3. Select main branch from the options pane. (Main replaced Master as terminology to describe the primary code branch)

# Credits
- Social Links
    - The social links used in the footer were taken from love running but with added hover styles that create a round border when the mouse hovers over them. They also increase slightly in size.

- Media
    - The images for the site were sourced from [wallpaper safari](https://wallpapersafari.com/w/2XmLKM) and also from [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/search/bitcoin/)

# Quality Commit Messages

I noticed an error I made when commiting changes to the README file on the 22nd-5th-2022. I left the page numerous times to grab links for images from the repository assets folder and to see if my markdown was rendering as I expected. Every time I left the page I comitted changes with poor descriptions of 'Update README.md'.

I realise these commits are poor quality and once I realised my error I changed my process of commiting to the README.
I opened up a duplicate tab for grabbing the links, and for checking how the markdown looked when applied to the README file I made more frequent commits. 
I was advised that changing the commit messages can interfere with the git history so I left them unchanged.
I apologise for an confusion this may cause.
